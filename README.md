What you need
* IntelliJ IDEA
* Java 17 or later
* MySQL

Install the application 
* Copy the project URL
* If you don’t have any projects open when you first start IntelliJ IDEA, you’ll see a welcome screen. The welcome screen varies from version to version, the video uses the welcome screen in IntelliJ IDEA 2020.3. Regardless of your version, you’ll have an option to get a project from version control. Clicking on this gives us the Get from Version Control dialog. You can paste the repository URL into the URL input box that we copied from the repository earlier. 
* You can then press Enter, or click Clone, and IntelliJ IDEA will clone the GitHub repository to the directory we selected. IntelliJ IDEA will also pick up common build tools like Gradle or Maven, and automatically download the required dependencies before building the project for you. 

Run the application
* Go to Maven section on the right side of the Intellij window
* Deploy plugins folder
* Deploy spring-boot plugin
* Double click on "spring-boot:run" plugin
